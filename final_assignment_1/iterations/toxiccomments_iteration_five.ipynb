You know it is impossible to ban anyone forever from Wikipedia, but you still carry on pretending that you can. You get a cheap thrill every time you do it. Enjoy yourself. You ban someone simply because you can - like Bill Clinton said he had oral sex with Monica Lewinsky \"\"because he could\"\". Because you disagree with someone stating the truth that is also noteworthy and very verifiable, is not a valid reason for you to have another cheap thrill by pretending you are banning that person for life. However, that is what you do because you do not have the ability to find something more financially rewarding to do. You are happy to sit and waste your time because you are not capable to find something actually paying some money to do.

You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.  Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena \"\"get nasty\"\" with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people \"\"narrow\"\".  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.  Out of all the characteristics of the Hellenic people, founders of Europe, you had to claim that their homosexuals were most importanteven iconic representations of the West.  Nobody said they were all straight either, which is something you have to admit.  Homosexual revisionism is not fact.   \"\n",

Again I'm sure that was not the case. I should also point to the fact that I havent been able to get much done in wikipedia as a result of user:Pamento repeatedly calling me an ass-hole or a homosexual, or a panty waste and while you threaten to bar me, nothing has been done to prevent him from uttering this nonscence.  Also I would like to inform you that from time to time my nephews come over and play with my computor, and it results in me typing in all capital letters.. no disrespect was meant by this, but somebody forgot to assume good faith and barred me because of it, even though i plainly stated I was having trouble.

Every single person in the world have good and bad sides to them, but no one spends time to explore the godd nature about what ever they are critizing. They are just like ordinary people only with abit of wealth and power, why not give them a chance like the courts in britian to day who even give crimanals a chance even when mudering some one in some cases, i am not comparing the royals to crimanals but i am simply saying 'every body in life gets a chance', some people just always look at the bad sides to life.

However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth. Again, this is from a HUGE defender of Cena's skill.\n",

I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism. \n",

      "Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of \"\"traditional\"\" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a \"\"respectable\"\" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.\"\n",

One was the popular girls group, and the other was the unpopular girls group. You may think that I would at least have fitted into the unpopular girls group, but I didn't. They locked me out of their little group and wouldn't even talk to me. They teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. I never got invited to any parties after 2nd grade; I never had any friends. The boys basically ignored me (until 7th grade when THEY were the ones who teased me mercelessly), while they flirted with the other girls. All the other girls would talk about was boys (when they weren't bragging to each other about thier home life). They never let me play with them, and the teacher didn't make them include me. In lunch and recess I would just sit alone or cry alone. In 6th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. The teacher just shook his head. Kids are cruel, and I will never, ever, NEVER forget the torture I endured as a child. Yes, I do think kids are buttheads.\n",
