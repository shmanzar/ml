Who ever added the nonracistpark section (sounds like an enlightened Chicagoite) was trying to expose the otherwise blatant racism and ignorance that is contained in the Neighborhood section.  I commend them for the effort.  Too bad the Moliners who complain are simply too stupid to understand...  If they (the good residents of Moline) are as cosmopolitan and enlightened as the pretend to be, they would remove the offending passages rather than complain when some outsider pokes fun at them for the stupid wiki page.\n",

If you're editors, you suck up to admins to try become one, if you're an admin, you suck up to other admins so you feel part of the \"\"community.\"\" Well, I'll leave you to it.
