I see from your above entries that you're convinced that he's been controlling the thoughts and actions of other wikipedians. Do you think he used his power to bend the will of others to get you blocked? but then again, since you compare him above to that old ally of the Romanian people, Adolph Hitler, maybe you think of him as a good friend, and would never accuse him of doing such a thing. Would you like me to ask him for you? By the way, if you find any more information that helps to expose the pathetic lies of Coanda please let me know.

If you don't know about 94% of Albanians (who were in a poll) support terrorist so called \"\"KLA\"\". 6% of the rest were killed by KLA because they cooperated with Serbs. And albanians can't be \"\"normal people\"\" since they are not humans at all and absolutely not normal (what kind of human being could kill a innocent baby and burn it allive, or burn 300 churches for nothing)? Ok I understand that but why do you protect them? Anyway why don't we speak Serbian? In my life I never met an albanian (animal names are written with first letter little ) ) that didn't say I hope you 'll die at least 7 times when we met (I was talking nice to them untill they didn't insult without reason). I am very angry because of this and it's one more reason why I hate them. To me I don't consider a human anyone who supports Serbian Kosovo independence (it's like someone supports slaughtering milion of innocent children).
