Many people in the UK (including me) believe that in time, the proceedings so far will prove to have been a major miscarriage of justice and UK newspapers are increasingly reporting it as such e.g. London Evening Standard - 14-10-10.  The case is notable, not just as another  murder, but for the breathtakingly incompetent nature of the investigation and for the internet wide sociological phenomena of a modern day 'witch hunt' pursued by those who think that Knox and Sollecito are guilty.  The entry above illustrates this.  The introduction of racism into the debate is unnecessary.  The protagonists need to be judged on evidence.  Implying that race is a factor is arguably inflammatory and seeks to divert attention from the evidence.  It is a good idea for Wikepedia to seek to present as full a picture of the proceedings as possible including the post trial phenomena of internet trolling on the subject.

      "Regarding polygamism with early mormons, Joseph Smith and his first group of 12 mens were using it all the time but hidding it from their wifes... Joseph Smith was married to more than 20 womens, without the knowledge of his wife, and problems occured when this first group around him wished to make this polygamism as an official rule of their sect.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the first wife of J. Smith was to know about her husbands several wifes, and made a scandal against it and asked for divorce, so angry she was against him, Joseph Smith changed his mind. It made J. Smith to think a little more about the problem and to make it a non legal part of their rules, which made the other male members angry at him. It end up as a polygamism rule, but first fully applied to all after Joseph Smith death. As many things in mormonism they first appeared after the foundators death, and are mostly made by its closest coworkers to assist them in gaining more power. \n",
      "It is also very well known that previously to Smiths writings about the supposed contain of its golden books, he was contacted by various members of masonics loges, and many of this church rituals, both sacred and profane, are directly taken from classical freemasonry and masonic orders'rituals. Many of the believes enumerated in the mormons books are also directly taken from those traditions, therefor the mormons books looks more, for a religions and myhtologies and esoterisms specialist point of view, like an amalguame or milk shake of several religious and sectars theories, well known within other religious groups, than a religion in itself. Nothing in the mormon books is original, all is taken from somewhere else, often with quiet a unimaginativ mind.\n",

      "The mormons researchs in latin america have given zero zero zero as prooves who could elaborate anything stated in the book of mormon as a source, or even ressembling source, for all the tribes described there. \n",
      "Another correction to what some have earlier stated here: there is a hell in mormons theory. \n",
      "Only true mormon, true knights of the later days saints, and else being it since as most generations as possible, have access to heaven,(the upper part, nearest to God). The downs part being reserved to just coming in members and half fallen members. And out of it is hell, for non mormon, who cannot access the other levels, and will never been able to be in the upper levels. It is clearly stated in the mormons teaching, and I heard it several times, by mormons priests, that there is no salvation for non mormon. Christian go to hell too, and none of the christian priests are recognized as such, nor are they aknowledge the power to baptise anyone, and they teach that even the first apostles, those walking around Jesus Christ, were not able to baptise others and that it is therefor their power was stopped there, until Jesus christ himself took to latin america, and baptised a bunch of by mistake-landed-there-hebrews, and later on this power was given by Christ and Moises itself to Joseph Smith. \n",

      "You are missing here also, the place of womens in the mormon church where political reasons, clearly prevail: It is for exemple today teached, that the upper god, is a goddess, the wife of God, and higher than him, and that she cant be named, and very little is known about her because she is OH! so high and special. It is also teached that the reason why women cannot be priest nor teach like priest, nor baptised, is that women are per birth closer to god than men, and that is therefor men only must try to come closer to god by manifesting their spirituality from an early age, all things a woman do not need to do as she has it all to begin with... It is also teach that men must fight harder to attain the same spiritual level as women have, and thats why women must do other things in the mean time: like give birth to more mormons members, do the cleaning and make food, and play missionary 1½ year of their life just before getting married, as soon as they return from mission time. All that good propaganda methods to secure the upcoming of new female members in that order, as well as keeping the youngsters in the old sheme of things, without risking having them asking certain questions, very up to date, very warms, and never answered by this church. \n",

As a Turkish Cypriot I have volunteered my time to improve and expand the article on Northern Cyprus with my sources been taken from websites based in Northern Cyprus. Some of the information I added was changed around and improved in a way so in which it can be understood. If you could compare the information with the original it is quite different with some sections using different wording and such. I was ready to negotiate with Dr.K and was even prepared to alter the section into my own words. But unfortunately it wasn't enough. The dispute initially started with GiorgosY who is now banned from editing. Many attempts to vandalize the page where made by this specific user over the past few weeks. Attempts to delete, blank, and vandalize the page was also made by various other users disagreeing with factual well sourced information which has been taken from archives and books written by professional historians. I would like to state that Dr.K deletion of the sections on Northern Cyprus where politically motivated. As a regular Wikipedia reader and editor I will be very disappointed if information which doesn't suit the specific nationalistic interests of users is deleted. Thank you!\n",

Payment of wages for labor is an emergent phenomenon.  In free markets, a number of things happen.  Technology advances, which increases the return to sepcialization.  Interest rates and average profit margins decline.  Both of these make it harder for one person to have all the skills to competitively run all parts of the business.  So, people start to sell just the input they're (comparatively) best at. That gives people a much higher return for their efforts than investing money at 5% interest, or trying to do all functions of the production process well.

My grandfather (born in 1904) had a Rufname, which was actually his second Vorname, but nowadays this is rather uncommon in Germany. Legally, one can use any of the Vornamen one was given as one's preferred Rufname and even change it without any prerequisite, so if the current German minister for economics Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg wanted to, he could use any of his 10 Vornamen as the name to be called with (except for the Maria, I guess -)). But in reality, such things rarely happen. Btw, the example shows not only girls can have many Vornamen, though 10 is a bit excessive, such large numbers of names are mostly confined to former nobility. There are even court decisions limiting the number of Vornamen, a mother wasn't allowed to give her child 12 Vornamen, but only 5.\n",

      "Most of us are sympathetic to your personal story, and we understand the importance to you of your relationship with Endal. However, as you have noticed, we have guidelines for what can be included on Wiki. I have been working to make the Endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible. Dogs that have long pedigrees are not (at the moment, but things may change!) considered to be notable on Wiki. Wiki, however, is quite fluid, and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry. The reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the Endal article on Wiki is not your relationship with the dog, nor its pedigree (it wouldn't matter if Endal was a mongrol), but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage. That the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm, and some questioning of the article - especially as you started the article on Wiki yourself. It just looks like a vanity thing - and we do get a lot of that on Wiki - some people don't quite get that this is an encyclopedia rather than a free home page for whatever they fancy putting on it! However, regardless of who started the article, I feel that the amount of coverage that has been generated by yourself for your dog gives it a certain amount of notability. As you are so close to the subject, there is the question of original research and other Wiki principles that may be broken. I would strongly suggest that you refrain from editing the article until you are more familiar with Wiki procedure - you may just push it into a decision for deletion either now or some point in the future (yes, Endal can be submitted for future considerations for deletion - passing the current discussion does not make it secure!). As you have some interest in dogs, would you be interested in looking at the current dog articles we have on Wiki (:Category:Dogs) and seeing if you can improve those? Warm regards\n",

Above that heading, the article is a mess of unsourced quotations, mostly. Those quotations are generally correct, and do give a good sense of what mainstream Jewish opinion is on evolution. But turning what is there now (and all the other material that is available) into a real article is going to be a lot of work.

      "Nothing personal Radh, I appreciate the input. My rant is directed at Toa mostly. I realize, Tao, you are being a smart ass as if my suggestion is not practical. You like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty, meaningless claims. How about this for a rule: 1) before you comment on other people, read what they say; 2) before you comment on the page, read the page. You seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters. You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page: actually read the page and actually read others' comments. While I believe Radh is well intentioned, he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page (please see the \"\"writers\"\" section, what used to be the lead section which Doom, who has been working ont his page for a very long time, moved lower  both Doom and I have been working on this page a very long time; both Doom and I have actually read the page because both Doom and I have actually written much of this page; the comments Doom and I make on the discussion page are well intentioned, practical, and based on knowledge of the page, none of which applies to your comments, Tao). Not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others; they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another. I suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit. Radh suggests it and it's an excellent and practical solution. It makes no sense to me. I can't help thinking you have tourettes or something, finger tourettes, that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit.\n",
      "Now a direct response to Radh. What I am suggesting is an accurate, middle-of-the-road definition. They are not simply ideas.  Please read my comments above. According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice, \"\"beat generation\"\" means most commonly a subculture, not a close circle. I'm not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle. I'm suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group. If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists, we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral, accurate way. So, while I appreciate your good intentions, Radh, this is not an \"\"excellent and practical solution\"\" because it's not an actual change  which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article. Here, I'll make it easy for you Tao: Beat Generation.  It's just right there.  One click away. Take ten minutes, take an hour, whatever. Being an effective smartass means being a well informed smartass.  \"\n",

I suggested on the TALK page that the easiest explanation of the Mantanmoreland fascination with Weiss, followed by their joint trip to India to the same odd village, where Weiss went to marry, is that Mantanmoreland is simply the person Weiss went to India to marry. That person's an economics geek from the East coast, who now lives with Weiss and has always editted on his time schedule. Duh. My comments were not only deleted, but my conclusions were labeled \"\"silly.\"\" They may be wrong, but I fail to see why they are \"\"silly.\"\" No evidence has been presented for Mantanmoreland being Weiss which isn't explained just as well (even better) by his biggest fan (Mantanmoreland) being more than a fan (but less than a sock). Anyway, thanks for the essay. Dunno why your ideas are allowed to survive on the evidence page, names and all, but mine are not even allowed on the TALK page. Sheesh.  \"\n",

Secondly, I'm not prepared to be trapped by yourself into 'naming and shaming' (Undoubtedly leading to you manipulating wiki policy to get me permanently blocked), its pretty self evident to all but the most deceitful who and what I'm referring to. Academics have always written in encyclopedias because encyclopedias are written by experts in their field. In huge editions many hundred may be involved. Even thousands. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography for example has over 100 historians writing entries (Thats an estimate, its probably more) So there is no doubt that if academics were recruited like any other scholarly project then an internet encyclopedia would be written quite easily. Fourthly, I have nothing to contribute to this article, other than the fact that encyclopedias do not use footnotes, and if they did, they certainly wouldn't have more than 60 for a relatively minor topic. Fifthly, academics have less time on their hands because they lead busy lives. The sort of people that obsess over wikipedia certainly do not.\n",

Just to clarify what I was after with singular v. plural (so as not to appear a plodding dolt), I meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural, the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre.  A point of general interest: the other, singular pinakes listed in the Suda entry aren't considered parts of the work known as the Pinakes, that being Πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων, καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν.  I don't know that I believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments, but who am I?  Going this route, I'd actually be alright with no mention of the/any Pinakes appearing on the Pinax page: this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste, considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at Athens.

      "Hello, thank you very much.  Yes unfortunately someone decided to go ahead and delete the page before anybody could mediate.  After 10 days the discussion was still very much active and no warning was given of deletion, or consideration of the fact that I requested mediation to resolve serious questions pertaining to bias and bad-faith.  Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with \"\"Delete\"\" endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered.

      "Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.\n",

There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples.

The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.\n",

The stacking of sources with the slant indicated shows merely they are not neutral and contain much bias. They amount to WP:Fancruft and WP:Coatrack.  Wikipedia is not obligated to include editorial bias. Detroit takes in plenty, its $1.1 billion budget with higher population density and higher spending per person than Atlanta show for example that weasel words like 'decline' and others inserted are inappropriate. An emergency manager is in place to alleviate largess caused in part by public sector union contracts - it shows responsible action by the governor. The comprehensive study shows the city of Detroit is in good shape and the Detroit Free Press reported it. The city of Detroit's home owner vacancy rate is 2.9%, in line with the national average.  The Detroit Free Press termed it a major population shift which is accurate. Many cities experienced change with suburbanization and freeways. The region is more populous and probably more prosperous than the 1950s. The city has seen multi $ billions in revitalization and it continues, the city serves an entertainment hub, has state of the art facilities, state of the art schools, a major university, casino resorts, a world class corporate center, a wealth of very well kept historic and national landmarks and restorations,  modern freeways, etc., is a partner on regional boards which did not exist in the past.

      "Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...\n",

We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.

Where is the information of Britney's former bodyguard speaking out? Where is the information of her being under the influence? Where is the information of Britney spending more time partying (with Paris Hilton, nonetheless) than being with her kids or concentrating on her music career? What about the fact that she was seen without underwear, more than once? All of us KNOW why Britney mangled her VMA performance! She was seen partying in Las Vegas 2 days in a row than focusing on getting her performance right! \n",

I have also contacted Wikipedia concerning this matter as I  feel it is insulting for one admin to delete articles based soley on what he feels are \"\"real\"\" users on Wikipedia. The user asking for deletion claimed the article was a vanity page. In fact, there is ample evidence from the early history of the Andrew Nellis page that it was created by the same people who eventually asked for its deletion. At first the article made light of Nellis' weight, health problems and political ambitions. This was changed and so-called vanity portions of the article were removed. When the article took the shape of an actual Wikipedia article, the users on Dalnet IRC, primarily those from the #Atheism and #memes channels called for its deletion as it no longer mocked Nellis' weight and other health problems.

This is my home town and I did a lot of research into it's history and everything so that I could make a good article on it. I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns  should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article. \n",

The biggest problem is the first section which had the  \"\"proposed benefits of basic income\"\" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.

      " Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.\n",
      " Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened\n",
      " Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.\n",
      " Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.\n",
      " Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.\n",
      " Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.\n",
      " Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.\n",
      " It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.\n",
      " Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.\n",

You had brought in your interventions in a macro-cosmical manner during the last two caucuses, which is why I am seeking your opinion before else. If you check Alanya article on wikipedia main page today, you will see that the name is rendered as Alaeddin Keykubad for the first and foremost one. To add an opinionated note, I am expecting little initiative from my fellow Turks on putting the name of an old sultan in correct form, ruminating cattle as many are. All at the same time as holding rather heterodox stances, it had fallen on me to defend the article on the mosque too.

I am user:Marygiove and I totally agree with you about what you write in your \"\"special archive\"\". At least you can console yourself thinking that you now are not banned, while others like me have no such a \"\"luck\"\". My only crime? To live in the metropolitan area of Miami (nearly 3 million people!) and so my IP is similar to the one of other italian users banned from wikipedia and who live here, like user:Brunodam and user:Cherso.  Anyway, as you wrote in your \"\"MFD Link\"\", it is clear that Jimbo's rules are not followed and that there are \"\"different set of rules for different users\"\", specially if there are nationalistic groups (like some  Croats who hate Italians) that pressure some admins to accept ONLY their POV on issues about the croatian Dalmatia.  I don't know if you are able to read italian, but may be you would be interested in accessing this website ( brunodam.blog.kataweb.it/2008/10/18/altri-commenti-sul-diniego-dellasilo-di-zara/), where some italians name you as an example of what is \"\"rotten\"\" in the english wikipedia about impartiality of some admins dealing with italians and croats.\n",

He promoted the ban (with another of the group named Direktor) of an article about the \"\"Italian mare nostrum\"\" written by Brunodam, and when you copied some sections of it in another article he believed you were Brunodam (or GiovanniGiove or Pio). In the section \"\"It is Bruno \"\" you can easily read that Noclador is convinced by this Alasdair that Brunodam is Romiaoi and/or  others (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AlasdairGreen27&diff;=prev&oldid;=230773625#It.27s_Bruno_:-.29).  In other words, the astute Alasdair throwed the stone and then waited for Noclador to do all the fighting for him! This trick has been done by the croat group even other times with other persons: it is a trick used many times by the Tito propaganda agents and modelled from the Stalin KGB. And it seems to work well, seeing the fight that has happened between you and Noclador. Sincerely. Marygiove.\"\n",

However, the only example of the retention of previous electoral results was with the Bennelong example (which is a historically important seat; oweing to the fact that the previous minister was indeed Prime Minister Howard, who had held for the seat over 3 decades, and no other PM has lost his seat since Stanely Bruce) so I therefore felt it would be widely understood that the removal of the previous election results from the page would be acceptable. The 2004 Election results remain on many multiple pages because no-one has updated these pages, and this is what I am striving to do. \n",

      "While the \"\"circle notation\"\" for benzene is popular in high school teaching, I have never seen a higher-level organic chemistry textbook that uses it, or met a practicing chemist who uses it. The \"\"Kekule notation\"\" seems to be much more popular among chemists. It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and \"\"electron pushing\"\" much more straightforward. The circle notation only seems to be common for some organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and some aromatic ions such as the cyclopentadienyl anion and the tropylium cation.   \"\n",

These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government.\"\" - J. Whyte and G. FitzGerald, 1991, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press: Oxford\n",
      " \"\"One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change.\"\" - S. Dunn and H. Dawson, 2000, An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Edwin Mellen Press: Lampeter\n",
      " \"\"Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'.\"\" - D. Murphy, 1979, A Place Apart, Penguin Books: London and it is situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, its population was 1,685,000, constituting between a quarter and a third of the island's total population and about 3% of the population of the United Kingdom.\n",

      "Posted on 29 August, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” \n",

He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth.

This video has been discussed amongst scholars and academics who focus on everything from art history to gender studies and from new media studies to sociology. If Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedic database that indexes \"\"notable\"\" historical and current events, then it would only make sense to include a page on this highly influential work that has greatly contributed to the emergence of feminist 90s politics and art.

THeir all worried about showing his picture publicaly, and this isnt even his picture. Apparently this picture has been distributed, even among Baha'is. These people havent even seen the picture in the archives. I cannot emphasize how different in appearance the two personages in the two photographs are.

My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a \"\"specialty\"\" page of its own.

I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is \"\"Sulaiman al-Shaikh - \"\"The caricature artist Naji al-Ali\"\" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection.\"\" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.\n",

He doesn't understand at all that we follow what the sources say, except for when it suits him. And that he insists that the information in the Lesbianism in erotica article about studies showing that men are more sexually aroused by lesbian pornography than heterosexual pornography makes my head hurt. He acts like we are presenting opinions as fact, when all we are really do is presenting the findings of several studies  not one, but several. In his opinion, we shouldn't include this information because he doesn't consider the evidence strong enough. Yet he considers \"\"just googl[ing] the most purchased adult videos,\"\" \"\"see[ing] what they're about\"\" and this \"\"would correspond to male arousal quite well\"\" to be strong enough evidence.

Obviously until this season, knowing where the HIIs were was not hard to figure, but now that we're getting HII action, this might make sense to add.  I would then also add them back to past seasons where relevant.   \"\n",

      "Your own description of the two sides seems to more clearly get at the problem here. There is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a capital) that makes recognition a prerequisite for a city being a capital, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Likewise, there is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a country) that makes recognition a prequisite for a region being a country, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Yet, in the latter case, I'm sure most here would agree that without recognition, a country is nothing, and really is not a country at all. Does the same apply to capitals? Well, we have limited situations in which this is even a question, and unfortunately the primary situation is this one, coming in the context of a bitter, and ultimately stupid, conflict. I personally think the same standard does not apply to capitals, as there is something physical (e.g. government institutions, place of residence of the head of state) to denote the capital. But if one operates under the belief that a state (and we all agree Israel is one, right?) can be without a capital, then maybe one can believe that recognition is a pre-requisite for capital status. Okay. I don't believe that, but go ahead.  '''''' \n",

The use of flags is, for the third time, a graphic means of presenting information instead of saying England, England, England, England, England, England, oh! Wales, England, England, etc., ad nauseum. It is NOT \"\"purely to render some colourful graphics\"\". The use of graphics to convey information is widespread in all spheres of communication, not just the internet. As for folk using it in other articles, well, if they do then that presents a consensus, doesn't it? No, the match was not an international but the nationalities of the players are relevant in football because for the last thirty-odd years since the arrivals of Ardiles and Villa, nationality has been and still is a burning issue in English football. There are people now who will reluctantly admit that Liverpool have more top-class English players than anyone else at present but still criticise the club for employing South Americans.

So. How can my life be made easier? SPI? I already filed one, on one sock master  (though that's probably a different person) and some other users have filed others (for example ). The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing.

That's edit-warring, which can result in you being blocked from editing. There's even a Request for Comment open at WT:TV. However, even if I was the only one complaining, that's irrelevant. It just happens that I noticed the lack of compliance. Removing bolding from the table is simply not enough; the table needs to fully comply, which means incorporating row and column scopes, plainrowheaders, and fixing capitalisation problems as a minimum. There are numerous errors in the table that should also be fixed. You're obvioulsy aware of the existence of errors as you have fixed some yourself. As for being \"\"easier to understand, easier to read, catches the eye better\"\", the two tables are almost visually identical, so those are not valid reasons. The only visual differences are the capitalisation and column width fixes and better compliance with MOS:COLOR. From an editorial standpoint, the compliant table is much easier to read and update.

I know Mahawiki has sometimes violated some rules, but remember that he was provoked to do so. You gave a warning on Mahawiki's page but you didn't warn any of the Kannada editors. If you don't know, all four(?) of them, Sarvagnya, KNM, Naveenbm and Gnanapiti had questioned the verifiability of the reference Mahawiki had provided. But had anyone else questioned it ? Still, Mahawiki e-mailed the file to everyone, then he uploaded it. Tell me wasn't all this done in good faith. Then these guys \"\"trashed\"\" his citation. What were you doing then ? You should've warned them. Mahawiki had to provide an online link to the article, which he has now provided. I think these same rules should apply to them as well. I question the verifiablity of Suryanath Kamat. Even if Suryanath Kamat may be a good writer (which I know he is not), but is what Kannambadi filling pages with, the same thing from the book. Kannambadi may be filling something else. And references from a single book could be WP:NEO. What about that ? And another thing, the way you replied on Kannambadi's page reeked of bias and partisan attitude. Really, I was never so dissapointed on Wikipedia.

In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives.

However, your second paragraph was a little too wordy for my liking and difficult to remain interested. Also, in your third paragraph \"\"with these types of communication..\"\" you did not mention any types of communication before, and therefore you cannot use these, until after explaining each type of communication.  Finally, I would suggested maybe making your points in your verbal/non-verbal method section bulleted. Overall, you added great information to our article, take my suggestions as you wish.   \n",

I really love your choice of bolding and italicizing your guidelines, however guideline three is not separate from guideline two, nor is it bold/italic. Finally there us a Which, in your final guildline that should not be capitalized. Great work Meagan, take my advice as you wish.   \n",

      "Hello  You have made some great additions to our article, especially the use of the General Adaptive Syndrome. However, in stage three, stressor is missing a letter (small typo). You had a great point of how inadequate sleep leads to irritability, however, I suggest that you change \"\"less inclined to communicate\"\" to less inclined to communicate effectively. Also, in your section of language barrier, you used the word intercultural, I believe interlingual is a more suitable term as culture is not only defined by language. For instance citizens of Quebec, have Canadian culture despite speaking a different language than most Canadians. Finally, the point on imaginary friend, might be a little far-fetched, but it would be fine to leave if you see fit. Great work overall!   \n",

      "Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that \"\"according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction\"\"). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least.\n",
      "Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework).\n",
      "Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that \"\"Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.\"\"\n",

I've also seen how administrators will back other admins up even when they are wrong, wrong, wrong.  By-and-large, Wikipedia is no longer a nice place for nice people.  In fact, it probably turns nice people into cynical, nasty people (and then they become admins).  If you're an admin with admin buddies to back you up or someone with 40k+ edits, you can pretty much get away with Wikipedia-murder here and the rest of us poor schlubs who came here thinking we just wanted to edit some articles and could make a difference with our contributions are the ones who get walked on and kicked while we're down.  What's more, the editors who try their darndest to do the right thing, get told they are lying and/or being disingenuous and get themselves blocked for doing the right thing while those who should be blocked for their behavior never see a block.

      "Here are my thoughts in detail....  I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire, with respect to culture, politics, literature, arts, and religion, as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations.  More specifically, Luoyang (洛陽) and Chang'an (長安) are similar to Ancient Rome.  However, you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea.  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan, until the fall of Baekje, Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence.  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence; but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan.  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries.  However after Japan is discovered by Europe, Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years, where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki.  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki.  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence.\n",

This latest \"\"tagging\"\" follows a full consideration and resolution of COI issues on the appropriate noticeboard. Repeated editing of resolved or previously discussed issues is part of the pattern of disruptive editing. Below is part of the content of the WP entry on disruptive editing:\n",

      "How disruptive editors evade detection \n",
      "\n",
      "Disruptive editing already violates site policy, yet certain editors have succeeded in disrupting articles and evading disciplinary action for one of several possible reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      " their edits occur over a long period of time; in this case, no single edit may be clearly disruptive, but the overall pattern is disruptive\n",
      " their edits are largely confined to talk-pages, such disruption may not directly harm an article, but it often prevents other editors from reaching consensus on how to improve an article\n",
      " their edits often avoid gross breaches of civility, especially by refraining from personal attacks, even though they interfere with civil and collaborative editing meant to improve the article\n",
      " their edits remain limited to a small number of pages that very few people watch\n",
      " conversely, their edits may be distributed over a wide range of articles that few people watch.\n",
      "\n",
      " Signs of disruptive editing \n",
      "\n",
      "This guideline concerns gross, obvious and repeated violations of fundamental policies, not subtle questions about which reasonable people may disagree.\n",
      "\n",
      "A disruptive editor is an editor who:\n",
      "\n",
      " Is tendentious: continues editing an article or group of articles in pursuit of a certain point for an extended time despite opposition from one or more other editors. Tendentious editing does not consist only of adding material; some tendentious editors engage in disruptive deletions as well.\n",
      " Cannot satisfy Wikipedia:Verifiability; fails to cite sources, cites unencyclopedic sources, misrepresents reliable sources, or manufactures original research.\n",
      " Engages in \"\"disruptive cite-tagging\"\"; adds unjustified  tags to an article when the content tagged is already sourced, uses such tags to suggest that properly sourced article content is questionable.\n",
      " Does not engage in consensus building:\n",
      " repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits;\n",
      " repeatedly disregards other editors' explanations for their edits.\n",
      " Rejects community input: resists moderation and/or requests for comment, continuing to edit in pursuit of a certain point despite an opposing consensus from impartial editors.\n",
      "In addition, such editors may:\n",
      " Campaign to drive away productive contributors''': act in spite of policies and guidelines such as Wikipedia:Civility, Wikipedia:No personal attacks, Wikipedia:Ownership of articles, engage in sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry, etc. on a low level that might not exhaust the general community's patience, but that operates toward an end of exhausting the patience of productive rules-abiding editors on certain articles.\n",

Often such editors are continuing to base future attacks and edits upon the rejected statement. Such an action is disruptive to Wikipedia. Thinking one has a valid point does not confer the right to act like it is an accepted rule when it is not.\n",

However, IMO the recent spate of \"\"refusing to get to the point\"\", repeated \"\"tagging\"\" total disengagement with \"\"consensus building\"\", \"\"ignoring of requests for explanations\"\", \"\"ignoring moderator suggestions\"\", \"\"rapid negative engagement with new contributors\"\" all spell out the pattern of disruptive editing that has long-delayed completion of this collective effort, and it deserves disciplinary action.   \"\n",

Unfortunately, they look (and are) so illiterate and uninformed that I am at a loss as to where even to start to explain the mistakes you introduced with your edits.  Do you even know Russian?  Sorry if this sounds a bit harsh, but your edits were so bad that I first mistook them for a form of vandalism, hence I did not care to explain my revert.  I will gladly show you step-by-step what exactly is wrong with your edits and why; that is, if you are interested, of course.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

      "Plummer published in 1896. Mike Christie and I are working on Bede's article, and the general assesment of most modern scholars is that the letter is genuine. Given Plummer's age, I don't think a mention in Laurence's article about Plummer's belief is that pertient, although I am pretty sure it'll make its way into the Bede series of articles. On the canon law bit, I think the bit I've mentioned is enough to establish that it was irregular, but that opinions are divided. (Gotta love those Victorian scholars who just KNEW what was right (grins)). I guess my main problem with Plummer is that he's over a hundred years old. More modern scholars seem to think that reliance on canon law wasn't as important to the papacy and the chuech at this point in time. For Laurence the important points are that he was consecrated by his predecessor and that some folks may have felt this was irregular. Plummer seems to be more concerned with what Bede was doing and saying that what actually happened in Laurences time, I'd rather throw this information into the Historia article.  - Talk\n",

He may have the strangest face I've even seen on this planet, but he has a brain, a very powerful brain, and that is often a rare thing to discover here at Wikipedia.

They usually only throw out a listing if they get offended personally, like little girls who get so upset because a boy throws mud on their face. LOL   Falcon, you can remove info, you can stick all the tags you want on Wiki listings, but those who know what real music happens to be do not care.  They know the difference between mediocre Coldplay and quality. They have learned the true reasons why material is thrown away or tags are applied, and they know that in most cases, those kinds of actions are meaningless.  I've seen listings here on Wikipedia that have had the same tags for years, and nothing more ever happened.  In fact, when I see a listing tagged, that tells me that the listing is probably of such high quality that certain jealous editors felt they had to deface it, so it deserves even more tribute.

Olga said afterwards that \"\"she understood no Russian.\"\" Then, in a letter to Mordvinov, she writes:\"\"Curiously, she seems to understand Russian.\"\" She said \"\"She understood no English\"\". Then Bella Cohen writes in her article in NY Times that she spoke in English to the invalid, and she answered back in English. Olga said: \"\"My nieces knew no German\"\". And we have copy of a post card written by Tatiana already in 1909 showing good knowledge of German. We have schoolbooks from Anastasia showing that she took serious lessons in German. Olga said, I knew I was looking at a stranger. But in Berlin, she said: \"\"I believe in my heart that she is Anastasia\"\", something she also repeated to Bella Cohen. She said: \"\"We showed her photos, and she did not react.\"\" Bella Cohen writes about how AA recognized Shura in a photo where Shura's face was hidden by a bell. Olga \"\"left Berlin with all hope extinguished.\"\" The very same day she writes her mother's secretary saying: \"\"How shall I tell Mama, this will kill her.\"\" (\"\"Mama\"\" would have been devastated by knowing her grandchild was alive, that would mean that the others had perished.) And she tells Frau Rathlef about how she would like to help \"\"the little one\"\", but has no money. Gilliard calls her \"\"La Grande Duchesse\"\" in front of Dr. Rudnev, and afterwords said that the woman in Berlin had \"\"nothing in common with the Grand Duchess apart from the color of the eyes.\"\" And that is after his own wife has shown him the congenital bilateral hallux valgus, the scars on the shoulder and the finger. And according to Shura, she had the same hair color \"\"with the same wave\"\". Clearly these two were lying, their own writings tell us that. , Olga wrote to the unknown woman after the visit: \"\"You are no longer alone, and we shall not abandon you.\"\" \"\"Longing to see you.\"\" \"\"I remember when we were together.\"\" Would she write this to a total stranger? Would she give her personal photo album to FS? I don't think so.

You should know that after checking the references again I discerned that you are abolutely correct.  Indeed, it is not Blackshire Belay that Baugh posits as his source for Afrocentic view number (ii).  Based on the footnote number 8 that appears after the first phrase in numder (ii), i.e., “refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole;[8]” Baugh actually attributes this view to; Williams (1975) and Williams (1997).   This prompts the question; is the second phrase that appears to be a continuation of number (ii) which states; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English: either” also included as what Dr.Williams posits?  For if it is attributed to Dr. Williams, I still say it is not Afrocentric and to posit this phrase as an Afrocentric view is in fact an outright misrepresentation of what Dr. Williams has stated.\n",

This is confusing for me as of why you had deleted my post as some other users send me a message saying how that it was very helpful and detailed. Also, concerning the evidence problem, would you please kindly replace the passage I wrote because it is not a biased passage and clearly reflects Messi's playing style, I have also used what other commentators have frequently said and if you have ever watched a match with Messi weaving his magic you will know and surely agree along with the millions who watch him that this is a very descriptive, accurate passage about his playing style.\n",

      "TABFor when he dictates his Commandments, the Eternal does not play with double meanings. Then here on the Sinai, the historical context is that of abandonment of circumcision until Gilgal. Therefore, only the bad faith of the fanatic victims of circumcision could twist the text in a misinterpretation that nobody should ever have imagined. For in order to restore circumcision, the rabbis were compelled to conceal the veritable meaning of the Second Com-mandment through falsifying the sense of the most sacred text of the Torah since directly written by God. The manipulation of the faithful is obvious. The sole attenuating circumstance would be pathological denial of the reality of the meaning of the Second Commandment, due to blind faith in Abraham’s commandment and to the deep psychological trauma its implementation provokes. It is indeed high time to put an end to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "TABBesides, it is possible to word a hypothesis about the two versions of the Second Commandment, that which forbids circumcision and that which does not mention it. Until today, the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy has been considered warranted by the fact that the manuscript was found again buried in the temple of Jerusalem at the return from the exile in Babylon. But it is impossible that God should have varied in his formulation of the Ten Commandments; the Levite rabbis varied, not God. The redaction of the book of Deuteronomy has certainly been altered, truncated from the ban of circumcision. One must think that the discovery in the temple was a whole performance intended to warrant the return to circumcision. For the rabbis only knew the book of Deuteronomy, a book of rules of boring reading whilst the book of the Exodus was well-known to the people; it was the source of religious education and it was impossible to falsify it, only its interpretation could be changed. The version of the Book of the Exodus is both the authentic version and the one written at the intention of Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, at the time of captivity, those who obeyed the divine will to respect the human body were likely still numerous. The Jews were divided about this point and the version of the Exodus enabled the rabbis to explain the fact to Nebuchadnezzar, while distinguishing the Jews from the Egyptians in order to avoid slaughter. The version of the Book of Deuteronomy was made up at the return from exile in order to warrant the new orthodox interpretation of the Second commandment of the Book of the Exodus.\n",

I didn't manage to get the 614 hits that are listed in the table for 2009.

Sjo's 'method' appears to be that (sadly) typical mentality of deleting or reverting any new editor's referenced data in a manner which wholly contradicts Wiki policies, and especially against edits that actually conform to Wiki policies. Wikipedia is rapidly losing credibility as a Worldwide contribution site by having a select group of admins and editors who think they can act as judge, jury and God over anyone's edits that they might disagree with, whether or not it is a properly referenced and conform-to-policy.  The strap line about Wikipedia being a source that everyone can edit is becoming a pointless and hollow statement, when looking at the pattern of dictatorial and hypocritical editing policies applied by a core of prejudicial and arbitrary editors who seek to suppress any new input and then have the audacity to claim that the new editor is a troll. Sjo's arrogant reply to my question over whether  he should be reported for inconsistent application of Wiki policies sums it up. Editors like him are showing that Wikipedia and its concept of global participation is badly broken. Sad really, but there you go...

      "I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:\n",
      "\n",
      " Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid \"\"academic phrasing\"\" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example \"\"social cost\"\" or \"\"social production\"\".\n",
      " Speaking of \"\"social production\"\" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by \"\"proportions of social production\"\" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between \"\"economic worth\"\" and \"\"social worth\"\" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between \"\"social product\"\" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.\n",
      " \"\"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people.\"\" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really \"\"inherently\"\" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern \"\"working class people\"\". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of \"\"economic worth\"\" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.\n",
      " Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question \"\"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?\"\" is not obviously or directly related to the question \"\"what was the social power of capital in 1840?\"\".\n",
      " Some ideas for expansion: \"\"Theoretical problems\"\" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). \"\"Wage price series\"\" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a \"\"real price\"\" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide \"\"snapshot\"\" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.\n",

At the article level, one most do constant war with propagandists without ethics, and certainly without any interest in traditional scholarship or research. Adding another layer of \"\"rulz\"\" is like adding another, harder \"\"level' to one of them shoot-em-up video games.  \"\n",

      "The inhabitants of Istanbul call the city Istanbul, armenians of Istanbul call that city KOstandnupolis or simply K.Polis, Russians call that city Stambul, some muslim nations call it Astambul but we all now that the name of the city is Kostantinopolis as it was found by Constantine and for 1000 years it was the capital of Byzantine EMpire by the name Kostantinopolis. Leningrad was Petrograd, Peter, Peterburg, Saint Petersburg but initially and finally it was and is Sankt Peterburg.SO my dear Dobbs, may be you read Kartuli and now that Georgians call their capital Tbilisi it is Tbilisi de fact and problably will always be. But 200 years ago that city was not called Tbilisi. And even 80 years ago,the majority of the inhabitants of the city, who were not Georgian but in fact Armenian, kept calling the city Tiflis. That city was very well known in the Russian Empire as the biggest industrial political and transportation center of Transcaucasia under the name Tiflis, the residence of Vice Royal of Caucasus. You can open any map of Russian Empire and you will never see any single mention of the name Tbilisi in any map published in that period. So nobody is arguing that at the moment the city is called Tbilisi but you also should not have any guts to call the nationalistic past of Tbilisi mistifying. The generation  who used to live in the city named Tiflis is still alive.\n",

      "There are three things to point out about this discussion:\n",
      "1. The \"\"material\"\" concept of time. Time here is not intended as an abstract entity, a chronological coordinate, as we are used to.  A \"\"time\"\" is the complex of all existing beings, things, circumstances and processes occurring in a particular historical instant. So it 's like an enormous set including everything existing or going on at that moment. If you consider the next instant, another enormous set is determined and that 's different form the previous one, as many things or situations have been changed. So we are included in the times because we are among the countless things and beings \"\"contained\"\" in the flowing times.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Sorry Memoro, but I must notice that your feeling of a possible deponent behaviour of the verb \"\"muto\"\" is baseless and factually incorrect.\n",
      "Indeed, consulting several Latin grammars and dictionaries I found no trace, no hint of a use of \"\"muto\"\" as a deponent or semi-deponent verb, at least in the classics. Simply, when a verb is provided with both forms, active and passive, it cannot be a deponent.\n",
      "It is however true that \"\"mutare\"\", as well as \"\"to change\"\" in English, may have a transitive or intransitive meaning. When it is transitive there is someone who performs changing and someone who undergoes it; so we can use the active or passive form to determine who 's the agent. We can say  \"\"I change you\"\" or \"\"I am changed by you\"\", leaving no doubt on who 's the author and who the object of changing. In the second case (the passive one) it 's wholly evident that change is not due to my will.\n",
      "With the intransitive meaning instead, the concept of voluntariness of change remains more shaded and vague. When I say: \"\"I change\"\", I make quite clear that some changing is affecting myself, but nothing is said about whether this change is due to my will or to the events, circumstances or somebody else 's will. Thus, using the active form with intransitive meaning, we can leave an open door to both possibilities:  - a. I am changing because I actually want to, or - b. I am forced to change by circumstances or others.\n",
      "Therefore, whoever was the author of this maxim, he had a simple way to let us think that we might be the artificers of our own change. He only had to write the verb in its active form: \"\"mutamus\"\". A simple \"\"s\"\" instead of an \"\"r\"\". That wouldn 't even afffect the hexameter 's rhythm. But he (purposedly in my opinion) chose the passive form; so expressly underlining our \"\"passivity to the change\"\".\n",
      "Moreover, he used a special trick to give an even stronger emphasis to the passivity. Normally speaking in Latin, one would say \"\"et nos mutamur\"\"; but here we see \"\"nos et mutamur\"\". Exchanging the pronoun with the conjunction is a rare expedient to emphasize the latter (in Latin language, everything that comes \"\"after\"\" has higher importance in a sentence 's  context). This special exchange serves to point out that this \"\"nos et\"\" is not a simple \"\"et nos\"\"; we should translate it as \"\"and we too\"\"; but other stronger translations could be: \"\"and we forcedly\"\", \"\"and we ineluctably\"\", \"\"and we a fortiori\"\". \n",
      "All this drives me to the conclusion that the sentence 's author wanted to stress as much strongly as possible that we are \"\"passive\"\" poor things in front of the general changing going on through the entire universe. So the true extensive meaning of the phrase is:\n",
      "\"\"When everything existing in the universe is subject to change by circumstances and force majeure; how could we, poor little human things, pretend not being changed as well?\"\"\n",
      "This way of reasoning comes quite natural if you \"\"think in Latin\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. According to the ancient and medieval way of thinking, this sentence is nothing else than an Aristotelian categorical syllogism; i.e. the basic unit of logical reasoning.\n",
      "Here we have:\n",
      "- a major premise: \"\"Tempora mutantur\"\"\n",
      "- a minor premise: \"\"in illis\"\" saying that we humans are included in times \n",
      "- a conclusion: \"\"nos et mutamur\"\".\n",
      "That simply means we are forced to change because we are part of all things that are changed.\n",
      "In mathematical logic and set theory, these relations concern set inclusion. So here are: \n",
      "a set H containing all humans; a set T containing all times (as defined above) and an even bigger set C containg all things, beings, situations, processes, and complexes af all them, that are subject to changing.\n",
      "The minor premise states that H is included in T, the major premise says T is included in C and the conclusion is H is included in C.\n",
      "In other words this is what 's usually defined as \"\"the transitive property of inclusion\"\". Thus, a synthetic translation of our sentence in sheer mathematical terms is:   H ⊂ T, T ⊂ C   ⇒  H ⊂ C\"\n",

      "Hello. First, thanks for your contributions; you're doing some nice work. There are a couple of things I've noticed with your templates that could be improved, however. When you created a new version of Template:Cosmology at Template:Physical cosmology, and then set the old template to redirect to it, you hid the history of the template. Where possible, please put the replacement template at the same location as the old one, or move the old one to the new name, then put the new code in place. (If you're worried about making a mistake on the new template and messing up the articles it's used on, then use a sandbox.) If you do that, then not only do you keep the history of the page, but you make it easier for those of us that are watching the template to see the latest changes to it (i.e. those during and after the replacement). I've requested a history merge on Template:Physical cosmology to fix this (which means an admin will come along and merge the histories of the templates at some point).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, please make sure that you don't add extra whitespace (new lines) into the template, as that also appears on the articles if it's not in a noinclude tag. See  for an example of what I mean; your version had two extra lines at the bottom of the article, which were appearing in the articles the template was used on, whereas the problem is now fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, please categorize the templates you make. There's a whole load of template categories under Category:Wikipedia templates; the two you're most likely to be interested in are Category:Physics templates and Category:Astronomical templates (and their subcategories).

      "\n",
      "Despite what countless secondary sources that didn't bother do their research say, there is zero evidence (none) that whalers caused the extinction of gray whales in the North Atlantic. This is just another stupid assumption made again and again by lazy researchers. We don't know why they went extinct. We know they were hunted off Iceland, perhaps New England (iirc), and perhaps elsewhere (the Basques were at least aware of them c. 1611). We don't know the historic size of that population, how long they were hunted, how many were caught per year, or the composition (sex, age) of the catch. Do not restore my revert until you find proof (not circumstantial evidence, e.g. increase in whaling activity on entirely different species coincided with the disappearance of the gray whale in the North Atlantic) that whaling was the cause of the extinction of Atlantic gray whales (good luck with that, because you won't find it).\n",

      "Weasel Words\n",
      "Your examples of improving weasel statements should be appreciated for what they are, but unfortunately, they don't really apply here.  The full process you linked to involved escalating from \"\"some say\"\" to \"\"BUsh's critics\"\" to \"\"Michael Moore\"\" followed by accounts of a specific statement, namely, Moore's letter to Bush.  Here, that process has not been fully employed.  Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  \"\"Michael Moore said whatever\"\".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been \"\"long accused\"\" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean \"\"you can find it somewhere else\"\", it means \"\"It's been or can be verified to be true\"\".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Citing the opinions of these articles\n",
      "Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this \"\"particularly notable because\"\" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.\n",
      "It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of \"\"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial\"\", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's \"\"sourced\"\". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.\n",
      "So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.\n",
      "Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).\n",

They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse\n",

      " I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. I need to go back to square one and add academic rigor (if possible) to global warming and denialism. [Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as \"\"academically rigorous.\"\"]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say \"\"article\"\") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a \"\"denialist\"\"; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an \"\"expert.\"\" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not \"\"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not \"\"article\"\") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the \"\"so what?\"\" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too. I also wonder whether I should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank-you to the editors who revert me, every time they do so. Or maybe a barnstar? I dunno; some token of gratitude or other. •  \"\n",

It cannot be redundant in general since if we take a non-empty set X and choose a non-empty proper subset U of X, then the \"\"topology\"\" on X consisting only of U would satisfy the two axioms you stated but would not contain X nor the empty set. Of course, this is a trivial example. \n",
      "Suppose we call a collection of subsets of a set X a \"\"relevant topology\"\" (this is not a real name; just something I made up just now so it is easier to talk about these things) if it satisfies every axiom except possibly that \"\"X and the empty set are in the topology\"\". Then a non-empty set with a \"\"relevant topology\"\" that is Hausdorff (here \"\"Hausdorff\"\" means that any two distinct points are separated by neighborhoods; the same definition as the usual one on topological spaces) would necessarily have to include the empty set in the \"\"topology\"\". Thus for \"\"many\"\" topological spaces, requiring the empty set to be open is indeed redundant. \n",
      "On the other hand, the requirement that the whole set X be open is in general not redundant with fairly natural topologies (I suppose). For example, take any topological space X and let Y be a set containing X as a proper subset. Declare a subset of Y to be open if and only if it is in the topology on X. Then this \"\"relevant topology\"\" on Y satisfies every axiom that a topological space should satisfy except that Y itself is not open. For example, X could be some Euclidean space with the standard topology (and Y could be any set containing X as a proper subset). But this construction is probably not very interesting since (at least as far as I can see) there is not any new information or insight obtained.\n",

The letter I wrote above was in response to my discovering that Aeon1006 had started engaging in other \"\"roles of trust\"\" on WP, namely he is now a mediator.  The \"\"evidence\"\" that follows was copy/pasted from an AMA letter that was deleted and not responded to.  Aeon1006 never really responded to these allegations at all.  If I am incorrect, I would sure like to see a link.  I firmly believe that mediators should be neutral, and for the above numerous reasons, I do not believe that Aeon1006 can be so.  Furthermore, I do not believe that Doc Tropics can be neutral either, seeing as how he posted his opinion on an RfC BEFORE the accused party had even written a response AND because Doc Tropics was also an online friend of one of accusing parties.  I understand the need for your to \"\"stick up\"\" for your friend here, but there really is no basis for your accusations that this was \"\"mean-spirited attack.\"\"  In fact, you're completely missing the big picture here - that Aeon1006 completely and unquestionably violated the trust of his client and turned against the very person he had promised to help.\n",

This article should be simplified, with some history, some definition (the explanation that gaming refers to the business of offering gambling games for instance is very important) and some short paragraphs that lead to main topic articles.

People read to retain information the right set up enhances that . Too many pictures are a distraction . They take away from the knowledge . More fleshed out sections can help . Ill brainstorm on that until later . I guess add the picture, if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little, maybe it will balance itself out more. The third option is we can fill out some sections more . Make it more balanced and then add the zines' photo, after, so it Accentuates and isn't the meat and potatoes of the section .  the sections of \"\"influence on other genres\"\" .

Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others \"\"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system\"\", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with \"\"- For a start,\"\" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!

So whereas all Brahmos are Brahmo Samajis, the reverse is not necessarily true, and which is why Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj cannot be merged and in fact will differ at certain places.

      "The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. \n",

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",

I am clear on a concept, which Chandrasekhar calls \"\"specific intensity\"\", which fully characterizes the radiation field in a medium, without physical surfaces.  is the energy passing thru an area element dA into a small solid angle  about the normal to the area element in a small frequency band  in a small time interval dt. It has SI units of watts/meter^2/sr/hz. Apparently many people refer to this as \"\"radiance\"\". Can we please settle on a term for this concept, and use it consistently? \n",

It cannot have the same name, because its only like, half of the specific intensity. How do we describe the fact that this radiation is independent of direction, as long as that direction is out of the physical surface?\n",

African dance is not jazz. How the show presents dance versus this page being a primer on dance is a non sequiter. African dance comes from AFRICA, not from jazz dance. How in the world is that subjective? This is obvious. You changing it back to being from jazz dance is actually what's subjective. Funk is STREET. Do some research. Electric Boogie is not a separate sub-style of Electric Boogaloo. It's more like a nickname for Electric Boogaloo, i.e. Michael/Mike, Jennifer/Jenny. So I don't understand why you would list this as a sub-style/variant of Electric Boogaloo. To be completely honest \"\"Electric Boogie\"\" is actually a song. People do the Electric Slide dance to the song \"\"Electric Boogie\"\". Think about the laymen who are reading this page. Because of your suborness, they're going to walk away thinking it's actually a separate dance style when it's not. Nothing that I've said above is subjective. It's based on facts. How can you to call my changes ill-advised and subjective while at the same time claiming the content you added was implemented \"\"in such way that WP:OR and needless debates on what divides styles does not occur.\"\" Are you serious? The wikilinks I provided at the beginning of this paragraph has citations in those articles proving that what I'm saying is true. The dance styles table in this article has ZERO SOURCES.

My feeling is there is no reason to go overboard questioning the basis of these claims, since it is simply possible to write the entry making clear that they are claims. It is not the place of this talk page to conduct some kind of forensic investigation into the validity or otherwise of Mr Langan's IQ (I'm not saying that is what you are doing, just making a point). I agree with you that at this high end of the scale the measurement of IQ probably becomes quite inexact, but after all that is not Mr Langan's fault. I note also that not only is there no evidence Mr Novelly is lying, neither is there any evidence that Mr Langan has lied. That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources. I think it is clear that Mr Langan is, as you put it succinctly, frickin' smart. That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be. I note for the record that this obviously does not mean Mr Langan's CTMU theory is correct, but neither does questioning Mr Langan's IQ undermine his CTMU.\n",

I can't say I disagree with it though I thought including a reference to the difficulties of using modern forensics to date ancient mummies was useful...to illustrate how impossible it was to claim the mummy was just a young person when he died. The Gabolde note, though is quite correct since it does place undue weight on the views of one scholar when there are so many differing views on the KV55 king. Thanks for pointing out that Waenre was actually part of Akhenaten's titulary. Gabolde certainly knew this but I did not. I thought it was another epithet like Meryamun.

No harm done, as I was offline of WP briefly at the time myself  and I learned a lot in the process of restoring and improving the article to WP Notability standards, a lesson I've applied elsewhere.  I also learned more about the WP distinction between Primary and Secondary sources.  The result is all to the good. I'll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing, though I think on first sight that the template's terse wording  \"\"This article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past\"\"   could be clearer as to its intent: does this really suffice to, in your words, \"\"let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason\"\"?  I hope so, though it was not obvious to me: it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue.  If you can see it that way, as a relatively novice editor might, perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect, with some procedural directives and relevant links, to the original PROD and the policy guidelines for continuance.  I defer to your experience and good judgment. \n",

      "What, what?? Ooh no, I don't do FA-class – reviewers are much too awkward to deal with at that level. A-class coupled with GA are my limit. And as far as this article goes, it doesn't need improving, it needs a 100% rewrite – it has become far too sloppy and contains so much trivial stuff that the prose is terrible to read in places, events are all over the place (i.e. not very well written, chronologically speaking) and it isn't very encyclopedic any more. No wonder it was delisted and no one wants to promote it, which is a shame given that this man was a true British hero. In contrast Napoleon's page is well written, has better focus, and is clearly of a higher standard. If I were to rewrite this, I'd literally spend months starting from scratch in sandbox and simply replace the lot when done. I don't think \"\"leadership\"\" is required, too WP:OWNish. Simply needs someone to be WP:BOLD and redo the whole page objectively, from birth to death, without all the off-side commentary that currently plagues the page. Unfortunately, I'm tied down writing an extensive article on Napoleon's entire military career, and I'm only up to 1796 after months of reading – long way to go yet.. so even if I were to consider rewriting this, it wouldn't be until sometime next year, at the earliest, once this other article has been through the process of several long-winded PR/A/GA reviews, first.\n",

That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) \"\"Ebonics\"\", (2) \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" and/or (3) \"\"African Language Systems\"\".  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.  \n",

      "You state or pose as an interrogative Æµ§œš1; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing \"\"Ebonics\"\" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply, I say what I have said and I reiterate it here;  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number (iii) is not Afrocentric at all.  I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English\"\" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English\"\" (and thus a rejection of the notion of \"\"African American Vernacular English\"\" but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)\"\" is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.    \n",

      "Now, with regards to your interroagative concerning whether the first paragraph of the OUSD Policy Statement  “could be interpreted as meaning that parents don't have to endorse the controversial classification to accept the services offered”.  My reply is; the OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD who are uncomfortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do not or did not indentify their child’s or childern’s home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that the resolution does not pertain to them.  The OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD are uncofortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do or did not indentify their childrens’ home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that, if they believe their home, primary or native language is English, Non standard English, Black English or African American Vecaular English (i.e., the language slaves or dogs born in the master’s house) they can continue receiving the Special Education, Speech Pathology a\n",

I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.

However, since this is done off screen, and also the canary is caged, my assumption was that 47 snapped his fingers and the canary stopped chirping.  This would seem to fit in with the fact that 47 takes care to take the cage with him out of harm's way when he hears someone coming.  Just saying that we don't know that 47 kills the canary, particularly since the sound is more like the snapping of fingers then the breaking of a creature's neck. Any comments?\n",

Apart from there being facts/proof to indicate that Saraswati did exist as this dry river ( including geological facts as to why it dried up) The evidence also points to the fact that it was NOT a tributary of the Indus, ( refuting point 3 of the passage quoted above ) and in fact drew the waters of the Sutlej and the Yamuna to be a river system of it's own. And though a large number of sites have been found along this river system, none of them are of the scale of Harrapa / Mohenjodaro, leaving the Indus Valley tag as the correct one. Saraswati did exist,today the timing is disputed and not the existence, Wheter it is vedic and indic vs Harrapan and non vedic is more disputed today than it's existence.\n",

      "1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.\n",

This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \n",
      "We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \n",
      "In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \n",
      "We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal.

A portion of his remarks summarized “the secular case against same-gender marriage.” He cited the 2006 decision of the French parliament rejecting gay marriage so that children “do not suffer as a result of situations imposed on them by adults.  The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” \n",

      "I hate to bring this up, but I don't care if the content you removed from National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma was relevant or not; the edit summary you left was, in my opinion, inaccurate, and, more importantly, was really insulting to me. You shouldn't just remove everything that makes the office unique; how's it different from every other office then? Undoubtedly, some of that information was in fact irrelevant or excessive, but instead of actually doing anything to help the article, you have done nothing more than strip it down. I know that you have made some great contributions to the wiki, but that edit summary was kind of like a slap to the face. If the content you removed was entirely non-unique and useless, then your edit summary might have been a bit more justified, but that was most certainly not the case. I'm not going to call you lazy or insult you (I don't think you're lazy, that's not what I am implying), but I am going to say that you could have done better. I've dealt with enough of this sort of gesture. Through all of this, I am trying to remain as civil as possible, but if you are going to say that you don't like the article as is, make more of it than simply stripping it down. There are other areas of the office's history which I would far rather expand upon, but I would likely be heavily restricted in terms of finding non-primary sources. I hate WP:PRIMARY enough; that's one of the reasons I been dealing with many problems from some editors. That's part of what forced me to userfy the page, which in turn is part of the reason for which next to no editors aside from myself have edited the article. No one wants to edits a user space draft apart from the relevant user. That's why I have received little input on the article. In any case, please just be kinder in the future; I intend no offense here, and I will admit that there were and are problems with the article, but please do not just go around removing cited content without also helping to build as well. Please don't take any offense or think me \"\"foolish\"\" or something (I don't know what you will think when you read this) like some editors would. I don't want this to be some sort of major issue in the future; I just really don't want this to happen again. Please take all of this to mind. Sorry if what I have written here is excessive, but I felt that I had a lot to say to you; thank you.  (talk) \"\n",

Further, user Thatcher131 deemed that since I had been banned, I would not be given an arbitration request, even though the arbitration request. So now it is impossible to even get a hearing on whether this information should be included. This whole affair is really beyond sad and is an indication that pro-Israeli censors are not interested in truth, but are rather interested in imposing their will. Having now dealt with you first hand, I am no longer confused as to why most of the civilized world holds a negative view of Israel and Israelis. May fate continue to justly bring misery to your oppressive lives.\n",

      "Ok, I got it,  made an error when he all of a sudden banned me for one week without warning.  It was originally for sock-puppetry (which was a false accusation in the first place) but he really meant the ban because his \"\"reason should have been persistent rvs against consensus\"\".  Again, where are these persistent reverts against \"\"consensus\"\"?  I tried to edit an article about a bridge awhile back, got hammered by Noclador/Gun Powder Ma for adding citations.  Most people who actually looked at what I was trying to do stated I was editing very civil, and that these two were out of line of how they attacked me.  This time I'm trying to add back citations (and including extra ones) that show the use of Adesc Aut in Ladin.  Ok, there is disagreement if it is proper usage or not, what is new?  Noclador says he knows Ladin scholars who are adamant against its use.  Ok, get them to publish something and we can cite their opinions and add it to the article.  I do not care.  He has become utterly obsessed that I am part of some conspiracy.   It was originally a user from the Netherlands who added the Adesc Aut ,because there are a few Ladin websites that use the term.  i added the an official trilingual document from Ortisei using that term.  Are they wrong?  Maybe, maybe not, whatever, we simply cite references, we don't cite what someone told us down at the local coffee shop.  But, I dare edit any page in Noclador/Gun Powder Ma's domain, and I must therefore be attacked.  If I'm banned for a week, those two should be banned for a month for their constant bashing of anyone who edits the pages against the way they feel things should be.  No compromise, no sharing.. we are going back to the good ole' days.     \"\n",

      "Dear Baba: Your words are wise. But I am sorry for not sharing your optimism. I prefer not to have my back to Muslims. My best Muslim friends turned against me once I told them I am out. They were not just ignorant Muslims but doctors and professors. Many of them subtly expressed their desire to see me dead, even though no one actually threatened me. I saw it wise to move to another country and keep my whereabouts guarded. I think I can do without Muslim cooperation and have little need for their friendship. They will stab their best friends in the back. I do not trust their smiles and offers of friendship. That is called Taqiyyah (the art of deception or what they term as “diplomacy”). That is their way to lull you into a false sense of security. Sorry BYT, nothing personal my friend. Once you leave Islam you will understand everything I say and I would love to sit and share our experiences while sipping our cold beers. I played that game of deception too without even thinking about it or being conscious of it. I too got involved into censoring facts about Islam just as Anonymous Editor so zealotry doing here. I wrote articles lying about Islam to present a false image of it, without even thinking this is dishonest. All notions of good and bad faded. All that mattered was da’wa. It was so natural to lie and all seemed so okay. I don’t dislike the Muslim converts here. I feel sympathy for them as I see myself in them. I hope that they too wake up and see the truth. What they do not know is that they have become agents of evil.OceanSplash14.Dec. 2005 02:48\n",
